What I’m looking for’s gotta be on the computer. It’s probably got some clear ICE but that shouldn’t be a problem
Figures, this is a student’s dig, they’ve probably got it written down somewhere around here
Right, this thing needs a key and some combinations. I should look for a key first
Huh, an analogue key. Not seen one of these for a while
Aaaaaand… There! Let’s see what’s inside
Huh, looks like a password or somethin
Nice, now to actually grab the file
Huh- Kid locked the PC with hard-ICE, bet the password’s written down somewhere obvious. As for the username? Kid might have some branding, use his screen-name or something dumb like that
A four digit code, probably useful
Cabinets… Cabinets… How come just one has a keypad?
Kid puts all that hard-ICE on the PC and leaves the code to his analogue data written on a poster. Too much money, too little sense
Another fucking code, this looks like a password too! Honestly this kid deserves to be robbed.”
Now that’s an old trick. Wonder who the little punk learned this mistake from?
A tiny little lockbox? NNnnnngghh- okay, not actually worthless, looks like it needs an… analogue key? Should’a brought my lockpicks…
The key works… God, Rigg would mald if she knew how careless this kid was when he didn’t buy his entire security system
A business card…
